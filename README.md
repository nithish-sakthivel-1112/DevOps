# My DevOps Journey

Hello, everyone! 

I've been learning DevOps for the past 8 months. However, I felt like I lost track at some point. After analyzing where things went wrong and reviewing what I had done, I decided to restart my journey.

Iâ€™m going back to day one, starting from scratch. I will document everything I learn, and the source codes will be uploaded to this repository, categorized week by week.

My challenge is to ensure this repository stays updated with everything I learn. 

Stay tuned for my progress!
